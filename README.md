# Neural-Network
A Layman's Guide to Neural Network by Md Sakhawat Hossen
In this project, I have taken all the pains and tolls to describe all the inner workings of the Neural Network in a very easy-to-understand language, but I have not dropped the mathematics. Slowly and gradually, one will be able to decipher the complexity of Neural networks by sailing through graphical representations and mathematics built from scratch. You are welcome!
